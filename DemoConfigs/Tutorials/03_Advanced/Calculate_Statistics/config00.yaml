# This tutorial shows how to build the some statistics of a given data set
#
# For this, we use a Random Number is Generated and then calculate its minimal and maximal values
# as well as the average and sum over 60 seconds
#
# In order to generate the statistics, we set up a custom connection, which we call every second.
# This connection demands an update of all inNodes prior to every execution (see Update_on_Demand Tutorial)
#
# The connection than calles the custom calculate_statistics function. This function saves all incoming values and
# calculates its statistics after a number of times, this funciton was called, which is specified by the count parameter
#
# The Output of this callback is then split/unpacked to the predefined nodes, which then Log the value on Change.

import: callback.py

nodes:
  - name: Random1
    default: 0
    type: Function
    callback: getRand
    onChange: log_value

  - name: Min
    onChange: log_value

  - name: Max
    onChange: log_value

  - name: Sum
    onChange: log_value

  - name: Avg
    onChange: log_value

connections:
  - name: Build Statistics
    type: custom
    callback: calculate_statistics
    frequency: 1          # Call this Function every Second
    demandUpdate: true    # Demand an Update of the Random1 Node
    inNode:
      - "Random1"
    outNode:
      - "Min"
      - "Max"
      - "Sum"
      - "Avg"
    split: true           # Unpack the values coming from the callback and split them onto
                          # the outNodes => First Value to "Min" and so on

    kwargs:               # Give Additional Key-word arguments for the function
      count: 60           # Set how often the statistics should be calculated. In this case
                          # every 60 values. Since this connection demands one value per second, this is roughly
                          # once per minute. (Roughly due to a slight execution overhead.)
